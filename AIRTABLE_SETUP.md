### Step 3: Get Your API Credentials

1. **Go to Account Settings** in Airtable
2. **Generate API Key**: Create a personal access token
3. **Find Base ID**: In your base, go to Help > API documentation
4. **Copy Base ID**: From the API documentation URL

### Step 4: Configure Environment Variables

Update your `.env` file with your Airtable credentials:

```env
# Airtable Configuration
VITE_AIRTABLE_API_KEY=your_airtable_api_key_here
VITE_AIRTABLE_BASE_ID=your_airtable_base_id_here

# Airtable Table Names (match your table names exactly)
VITE_AIRTABLE_PROPERTIES_TABLE=Properties
VITE_AIRTABLE_USERS_TABLE=Users
VITE_AIRTABLE_BOOKINGS_TABLE=Bookings
VITE_AIRTABLE_ANALYTICS_TABLE=Analytics
```

### Step 5: Add Sample Data

You can add some sample data to test the integration:

1. **Import Sample Properties**: Use the demo data from the app as a reference
2. **Create Test Users**: Add a few user records
3. **Add Sample Bookings**: Create some booking records
4. **Add Analytics Data**: Add monthly analytics records

## üîß Testing the Integration

1. **Restart your development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Check the console**: Look for Airtable connection messages
3. **View Properties**: Navigate to the Properties page to see your data
4. **Check Dashboard**: Verify stats are loading from your Airtable

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices

1. **Keep API Keys Secret**: Never commit API keys to version control
2. **Use Environment Variables**: Store credentials in `.env` files
3. **Limit API Key Permissions**: Only grant necessary permissions
4. **Regular Key Rotation**: Rotate API keys periodically

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**"Airtable running in DEMO mode"**
- Check that your API key and Base ID are correctly set in `.env`
- Restart your development server after changing environment variables

**"Failed to fetch Properties"**
- Verify your table names match exactly (case-sensitive)
- Check that your API key has read permissions
- Ensure all required fields exist in your Airtable base

**"Missing required fields"**
- Make sure your Airtable table has all the fields listed above
- Check field names match exactly (including spaces and capitalization)

### Debug Steps:

1. **Check Console Logs**: Look for detailed error messages
2. **Verify API Key**: Test your API key with Airtable's API documentation
3. **Check Base ID**: Ensure you're using the correct base ID
4. **Field Names**: Verify all field names match exactly

## üìö Advanced Configuration

### Custom Field Mapping

If you want to use different field names in Airtable, update the data transformers in:
`src/lib/dataTransformers.js`

### API Rate Limits

Airtable has rate limits (5 requests per second). The app includes automatic retry logic, but for high-volume applications, consider:
- Implementing caching
- Using batch operations
- Adding request queuing

### Real-time Updates

For real-time updates, consider:
- Implementing webhooks (Airtable Pro/Enterprise)
- Polling for changes
- Using WebSocket connections

## üéØ Next Steps

Once your Airtable integration is working:

1. **Customize Data Models**: Modify fields to match your specific needs
2. **Add Business Logic**: Implement property rules and validations
3. **Integrate Booking System**: Connect with calendar and payment systems
4. **Add Reporting**: Create custom analytics and reports
5. **Set Up Automation**: Use Airtable automations for workflows

## üìû Support

If you need help with the integration:

1. **Check the Console**: Most issues are logged with helpful error messages
2. **Review This Guide**: Ensure all steps are completed correctly
3. **Airtable Documentation**: Refer to [Airtable's API docs](https://airtable.com/api)
